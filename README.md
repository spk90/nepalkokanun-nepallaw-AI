# 🇳🇵 Nepal Law AI — Legal Intelligence for the People

Nepal Law AI is an open-source legal assistant built to simplify access to the **Constitution of Nepal** and other **national laws** using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).

Leveraging powerful models like **LLaMA**, **Ollama**, and **Croc**, this system allows users to ask any legal question and receive contextually accurate answers instantly — all through a cloud-hosted API.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Ask Legal Questions in Natural Language**
  Query the Constitution of Nepal and get accurate, understandable answers.

* ⚖️ **Trained on Nepali Legal Texts**
  The model has been fine-tuned using government PDFs and official documents related to Nepalese law and constitution.

* ☁️ **Hosted via Scalable Cloud API**
  The AI is accessible through a RESTful API, making integration into websites, mobile apps, or chatbots easy.

* 🧠 **Powered by LLaMA, Ollama, and Croc AI Models**
  We use an ensemble approach with these cutting-edge LLMs for better understanding, reasoning, and contextual alignment.
